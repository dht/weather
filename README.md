# Weather

## OVERVIEW

write a simple, responsive, web app in angular/react that shows the weather of some city. The
user should be able to search for a city and save it to favorites (locally, a server is not required).
We expect to see 2 pages in this app. (weather page and favorites page).
We recommend you use a 3rd party UI library (material, prime, bootstrap, etc.)

## API

The API that you’ll use for this app is AccuWeather API. Please sign up and create a new app to get
an API key.
You will use 3 endpoints: location autocomplete for the search field, get current weather and
5-day daily forecast. Please read those API docs.
NOTE: this API is limited to 50 requests per day. our recommendation is to save the responses
and use them locally during development.

## GOALS

1. Show us your coding skills - We want to see your strengths, don’t be afraid to go wild, add
   features and customize the design.
2. Readability - Your code should be readable and self-explanatory with minimum
   comments. Remove any unused code, console logs, and files. Use logical project
   structure and code separation.
   HOW TO SUBMIT
3. Push your code to your git repository and make it public (we recommend GitHub to use
   GitHub Pages with ease), name the repo as firstName-lastName-dateOfStart (John-
   Doe-01-12-2018).
4. Deploy the compiled app to your server or GitHub pages/Heroku/etc - MUST
   Send us the git repository link and a link to the deployed app (2 links)
